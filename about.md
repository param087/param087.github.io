Hi! I am currently working as a software engineer in [HSBC](https://hsbc.com/)'s [Commercial Banking](https://www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/our-businesses-and-customers/commercial-banking) department, where I am a part of the digital transformation team. Here we are making a set of applications on which customers can do their transactions in bulks, track them and authorized them if need.

Before that, I was a student developer at [TensoFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), Where I worked on building a traditional machine learning library in Swift Lang [swiftML](https://github.com/param087/swiftML).

Before that, I was a project intern in [BMC Software](https://www.bmcsoftware.in/), where we develop the blockchain-based PoC application for the license and API tracking of customers.

I am interested in developing better artificial intelligence and have working experience in computer vision and NLP. If you're interested in collaborating email me at [bhavsarparam087@gmail.com](bhavsarparam087@gmail.com)
